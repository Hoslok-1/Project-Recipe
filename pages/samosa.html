         Made with common kitchen ingredients, this Jain Samosa recipe is so tasty that your guests will not 
         stop asking for more. The filling of the samosas is prepared using raw bananas instead of potatoes, 
         along with peas and a handful of spices like cumin, fennel seeds, coriander powder, dry mango powder, 
         ginger powder, turmeric, garam masala and more. Since this recipe is Jain, it doesn't include garlic 
         and onion, but still is as tasty as any other regular samosa.</p>
